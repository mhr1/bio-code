Basic Application built using PD5 classes

basic_app.cpp is a simple application for primer design that can be used as a starting point for more specific apps.

To build in directory /primer_design/basic_app/ use command: -

   ./build_basic_app
   
To test: -

   ./example_command
   
This passes the sequence for the Arabidopsis speechless gene (At5g53210) in the command line as an example template.

The resulting output shows lists of forward and reverse candidate primers before and after sorting/selection, and then details of the best 6 candidate pairs.
